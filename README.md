## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies (with yarn!):

```bash
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This project was used together with our [CMSch content management project](https://github.com/kir-dev/cmsch) in the weeks leading up to the conference, where we could easily upload and edit the content. After the conference we shut down this system and the data has been copied to this repo (`src/models/static` and `public/img`), since it won't change anymore.
